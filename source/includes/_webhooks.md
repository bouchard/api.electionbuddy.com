# Webhooks

Our webhooks feature allows a URL, supplied by you, to receive HTTP POST
requests corresponding to events related to your election(s); e.g. when votes
are recorded.

The URL is configured through the Electionbuddy website, if enabled on your
account.

To enable webhooks contact an Electionbuddy customer support representative.
