# Introduction

Welcome to the Voting Integrations (VI) documentation for ElectionBuddy (electionbuddy.com). We continue to maintain both our legacy (version 1, or V1) integrations, as well our current (version 2, or V2) voting integrations to allow your voters to authenticate with ElectionBuddy within your own member or customer portal or customer relationship management (CRM) software.

**V1** focused on providing you with a method to generate a signed URL to send your voters to a specific election. **V2** expands on this by allowing you to give your voters a list of all running elections in which they are eligible to vote, and allowing them to vote in any or all of them in turn while being authenticated behind your customer portal.
